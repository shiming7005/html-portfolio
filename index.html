<h3>I am a digital product designer</h3>

<p>Ming Shi, I am a passionate and curious designer from China currently based in the Netherlands, with an interest in
    Conditional design, Responsive design in digital publishing and Digital typography. In 2015 I received my Master of
    Graphic Design from AKV|St.Joost in Breda, Netherlands. My design experience includes works which focus on branding,
    visual language experiments, colour theory, coding with Processing, and editorial design. By continually reading and
    learning, I am able to use an interdisciplinary approach to inform my design practice. The world in my eye is a
    process of evolution and self organisation, context and interaction. I see myself as a supporter/collaborator in this
    system.</p>
