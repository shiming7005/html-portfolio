<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Ming Shi, I am a passionate and curious designer from China currently based in the Netherlands, with an interest in
  Conditional design, Responsive design in digital publishing and Digital typography. In 2015 I received my Master of
  Graphic Design from AKV|St.Joost in Breda, Netherlands. My design experience includes works which focus on branding,
  visual language experiments, colour theory, coding with Processing, and editorial design. By continually reading and
  learning, I am able to use an interdisciplinary approach to inform my design practice. The world in my eye is a
  process of evolution and self organisation, context and interaction. I see myself as a supporter/collaborator in this
  system.</p>
